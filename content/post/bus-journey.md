I am big fan of bus travel. Still it is my only mode of transportation. The two reason I love it are wind and sight seeing. Whenever the wind kisses me I forget myself and start thinking about memories.

The best part of the wind (Thendral) is it kindles happiness, sad moments, memorable ones, wishes and missing. Thendral has complete effect of changing my mood and mode.

I donâ€™t think only thendral has this effect. Trees, plants, flowers and water also produces same effect. Bus journey sows lot of peace in me.

Not to forgot this wind has full potential to make me shed tears. Nature has answer to questions and triggers thoughts. Love how small things can create big impact. 

\*Note\*: Thendral is a Tamil word. Thendral is a type of wind which originates from south and produces soothing effect.
