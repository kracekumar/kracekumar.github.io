I’m attending <a href="http://recurse.com" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> fall'02, 2016 batch. I’m excited (yes, without emoticons) to be in RC and New York. RC is different from schools, boot camps, universities for various reasons. The two reason I like the most is “Never Graduate” and “self-directed learning.”

A lot to learn from peers, experiments, and discussions. Next, 12 weeks will be intense and what can a programmer ask for more than time to solve problems and understand how things for. Now, I’m afraid, 12 weeks may not be enough to learn what I’ve in mind, that perfectly justifies _“Never Graduate.”_
