This week, I reached the first milestone of the project - <a href="http://github.com/kracekumar/imon" target="_blank">imon</a> which I worked on for past couple of weeks.

`` imon `` is a command-line utility to record all network traffic and classify the data according to the domain name.

Here is a <a href="https://slides.com/kracekumarramaraju/who-is-eating-my-bandwidth/" target="_blank">high-level presentation</a> of the project.I am looking for code review on the project and happy to answer any questions.

I wrote a <a href="http://kracekumar.com/post/153116176705/my-experience-with-rust" target="_blank">blog post about my experience with Rust</a>. I am excited about the project and hope to keep working on it. If you have any comments on Rust or have any experience using it, please share.

Next, I will be reading about <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Distributed_hash_table" target="_blank">Distributed Hash Table</a> and implement in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>. Also, I havenâ€™t developed any project in Erlang other than `` hello world `` :-)
