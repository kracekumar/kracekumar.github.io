I have been using quora for almost _two_ years. I have connected my `` Facebook, twitter, wordpress, tumblr `` accounts.

Unless you are logged into `` quora `` you cannot read the post, on the surface this is true. If you are web geek you know you can look into the source code and read the page content and by pass.

__The Problem__

Now I am logged into facebook in `` tab 1 ``, `` tab 2 `` is loading quora url, after few seconds dialog box appears and I am automatically logged into quora account. Now I logout of quora and again I visit the quora url, I am logged back into quora. I deleted the cookies and tried again, still the same. Unless I am logged out of facebook I canâ€™t logout of quora.

This is F\*\*\*ING ANNOYING.
