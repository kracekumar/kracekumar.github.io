I live in 5th floor, my table is near window. I spent saturday by watching 3 documentaries and 1 tamil movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhu_Bhairavi_(film)" target="_blank">Sindhu Bhairavi</a>, yes no single line of code. Once I am done with movie it was 00:30 AM, now stepped into the balcony was mesmerized by breeze. I felt like a poet and casual thoughts.![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/60daab28929ba73e5ba12731fb6b90cb/tumblr_inline_mkhoixP3t01qz4rgp.jpg)

Yes breeze indeed brought a new thought seed from distant place, __“How about coding from balcony”__. No second thought, cleaned, set up done. All ready now. Truly great to sit in bean bag hearing Tamil song with laptop, random stray dog barking, car sound and cool breeze. ![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/187c2f9fa08a0ae58e70963d1af9c7d4/tumblr_inline_mkhoxg2Xlq1qz4rgp.jpg)

All set to code :-)
