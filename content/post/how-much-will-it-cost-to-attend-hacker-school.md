<a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/" target="_blank">Hacker School</a> is a three-month, full-time school in New York for becoming a better programmer for free, but stay, travels is yours.

I have no idea how much it will cost for travel from India, stay, food, internet, transit so I asked the question in <a href="http://www.quora.com/Hacker-School/How-much-does-it-cost-to-live-in-NY-for-three-months" target="_blank">Quora</a>. I got pretty good answers.

Then I started do my lame math.

## Monthly Expense(USD)

     Rent = 1000
     Phone = 80
     Transit = 100
     Internet = 40
     Electricity = 40
     Food = 250
     Snacks = 100
     Outing = 120
     Misc = 100

Total = 1830.

So let me round to `` 2000 USD `` for safety.

If I am right I need to pay advance for Room, let me add one month rent to total expense. `` 7000 USD `` now.

Two way flight will cost `` 60000 INR, 10000 INR `` for Visa. Assuming `` 1 USD to 55.0, 70000 INR = 1272.73 USD ``.

`` 7000 USD is 385000 INR ``. So total money required for me is `` 455000
 INR ``.

__Q__: How long will take to save so much money ?__A__: 30 months to 36 months.

So after 3 years these USD to INR must be higher and US food pricing, rent must be increased at least by 2% to 5%. So it will be 7350 USD.

By guess 1 USD will be 60 INR in 2015. `` 7350 * 60 = 441000 ``, Wow to spend 3 months in Hacker School I need to save money for 3 years.

Will my interest hold up ?

`` Time and Tide waits for none ``.
