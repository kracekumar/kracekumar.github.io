## Work progress

During the trip I was working on <a href="http://github.com/hasgeek/hacknight" target="_blank">Hacknight</a>, sent 9 pull requests, 6 merged to master, 3 pending for approval. Added 647 LOC and removed 110 LOC.We worked out of Cafe, room with data cards, phone internet without any high speed wifi connection. For first 4 days, I was unable to work because of my bad internet data card.

<a href="http://github.com/jace" target="_blank">Kiran</a> made better progress, was able to hold his github streak.

# _Note_

*   Amount expressed is in Indian Rupees.
*   In Delhi we got accodomation in friends place and food too.
*   We shared two rooms in Mcleodganj, so it was cheap.
*   We tasted Italian, Tibetian, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Israeli, French etc …
*   Butter tea is my favourite of the trip.
*   Dogs were synonymous to cafe.

Hope to visit the place again.
