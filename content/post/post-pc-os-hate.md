Smartphones &amp; Tablets are new plastic papers. Android and IOS dominates the market. I own Android Phone because its cheap. When it comes to Gadgets I am conservative. I really don’t like Android much because its written in Java and need a better hardware to run Interpreted Languages, JS. Android runs from low end cheap 4000Rs phone to Nexus Phone. So wide variety of device headaches to developers.

Every Android phone is one layer coated with device makers code, same with Linux distros. In Desktop/Laptop I really want to use Linux, give me a MacBook first thing I will do is (try to) Install Linux distro.

I don’t have such love for android or any current set of OS for Smart Phones, but I am attracted towards B2G because its web.

Let me wait for an year and see.
