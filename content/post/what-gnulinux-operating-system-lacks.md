I am GNU/Linux user for almost 4 years, saying that I don’t switch back to windows for any day to day activities, being said that GNU/Linux operating system’s lacks lot of \* applications \*. There are lot superior command line applications but those are intended for religious command line humans.

I have been using mac osx 10.6. for 3-4 weeks, it seems to have all applications but I don’t feel at `` ~ ``.

_Applications that needs to be improved_

1.   
    
    All mail clients like thunderbird, evolution suck big time. When you start connecting 4-5 accounts with more than 10000 emails, then slowly you feel the pain. I have used mutt but I have pain while reading mailing list replies.
    
    
2.   
    
    Native Twitter Client. There are decent ones like Hotot but it crashes often and I see segfault &amp; coredump. Then I switched to Tweet Deck.
    
    
3.   
    
    Decent Calendar application.
