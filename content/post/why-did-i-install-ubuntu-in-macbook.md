## Reasons

*   Mac doesn’t have package manager like `` synaptic ``. But you have App Store for apps.
*   You need to build `` xcode `` or `` gcc-installer `` to install any cocoa app.
*   I Use USB Data card as result I don’t have privilege to experience high speed broadband connection. As I have noticed OSX apps are heavy to download.
*   Linux fanboy :-)
