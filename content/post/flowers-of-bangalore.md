Bangalore is called the Garden City of India. How often do you walk into a garden? I visit often. I envy you if you own a garden at home!

Every day you can spot a lot of flowers and trees during transit to work, casual walk, etc â€¦ In the evening, trees welcome all passer-bys with chosen fallen flowers in the pathway. Especially golden flowers from Copper pod. Trees and flowers are predominant in the buzzing part of the city.

<a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com/flowering-trees/" target="_blank">Here is a list</a> of commonly found flowers and their details. The document includes 56 flora species description with the photograph, flowering seasons, vernacular name and origin.

Next time when you step out of the house or see through high raised building window find out the name of the flower you may see.
