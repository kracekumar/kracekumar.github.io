## Background about me

I am kracekumar, graduated from Amrita school of Engineering, Coimbatore in B.Tech IT (2007-2011). I am working with IBM India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore as Associate System Engineer from 14th July, 2011 til 16th July, 2012.(C\# developer but never wrote single line of code in c\# in IBM).

I am GNU/Linux user for 3 years and developed application in PHP, Rails, Flask(all are hobby projects).

## Scene

I was not happy with job at IBM and I had training bond for one year(14th July, 2011 to 13th July 2012), decided to resign from my job once bond period is over whether I have new job offer or not. I usually look for job posting in <a href="http://jobs.hasgeek.com" target="_blank">Hasgeek job board </a> from time to time. I was very interested to work in Linux, Python or Rails and wasn’t interested in Java or C\# or Windows Technology.

Then

Myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jackerhack" target="_blank">Kiran</a> had conversation in IRC and kiran revealed hiring policy for hasgeek is contribute to hasgeek codebase and if it is ok you are hired. I agreed to the deal.

## Contributing to Hasgeek Codebase

From 14th May 2012 to 18th May 2012 I worked on <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasgeek.tv" target="_blank">Hasgeek Tv</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kracekumar/hasgeek.tv" target="_blank">My contribution here</a>. Most of the code was already completed by kiran, but there were few incomplete pieces which I completed.

On 21st May 2012, kiran and me decided we will meet on 22nd May 2012 in CIS(Center for Internet Society). On 22nd May I was half an hour late to the place. Then Kiran, Siddarth and me had discussion(not an interview) about each other. Kiran and siddarth informed me that they are working on new project <a href="http://hacknight.in" target="_blank">Hacknight</a> for which they want me to contribute and depending on the outcome in three weeks, I might be hired.

## Journey

It was Kiran, Siddarth, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/geohacker" target="_blank">Sajjad</a> and I who worked on hacknight. The code is <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hacknight" target="_blank">Here</a>. I worked on hacknight code in evening after coming from office and saturday in CIS. Most of our discussion was carried out in CIS(Hasgeek office ) , IRC, Github.

I had initial learning curve looking into other hasgeek libraries like <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/coaster" target="_blank">Coaster</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/baseframe" target="_blank">Baseframe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser" target="_blank">Lastuser</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jace/pydocflow" target="_blank">Peopleflow</a>. Thanks for Kiran, Siddarth, Sajjad who answered all my silly doubts and helped to get started.

## My mistakes

I broke the code twice. Both were due to improper tests.

    <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/baseframe/commit/43f08689017bb1e0dfeb4f9e7e5d4efc47e6af8d" target="_blank">Baseframe broken code</a>
    
    
*   
    
    <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hacknight/issues/42" target="_blank">Hacknight code which I broke</a>
    
    

## Climax

On 7th June, 2012 Kiran informed hasgeek is happy to hire me after final talk on 9th June, 2012. All went well, I informed I am happy to join Hasgeek. I will be joining hasgeek on 17th July, 2012.

Finally if you have read so far you should probably look into <a href="http://beta.hacknight.in/" target="_blank">Hacknight Beta Version</a> and feel free to speak to me in <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kracetheking" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
