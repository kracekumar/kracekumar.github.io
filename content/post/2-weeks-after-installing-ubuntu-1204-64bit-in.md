Its been two weeks, since I installed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL279M8GbNseskfSem7bQD4U0eSOjCEBhK" target="_blank">Ubuntu 64 bit</a> in MacBook. Let me say how I feel about.

My setup isn’t complicated, I use `` sublime2, terminator, gnome-terminal, ipython, pypy-2.0beta, postgres, mosh, firefox-nightly, chromium, chrome, clementine, xchat-gnome, hotot(recent addition) ``.

Also installed `` nividia `` drivers for ubuntu. I am happy I installed ubuntu but had issue with right click and figured `` shift + F10 `` is short cut.

## Hate Hate Hate

If you are using data-card you must have noticed default `` modem-manager `` is buggy. If I suspend my system for 10 hours and try to activate the device `` no response ``. You kill the process and restart it doesn’t work, So I need to restart the machine. Really din’t find solution for it :-(.

Occassionally after resuming from suspend mode, system load is 100%, I don’t know reason is due to `` firefox nightly or hotot(I had lot memory leaks in past) ``, only way to find out memory usage of firefox is `` about:memory `` which doesn’t display tab wise memory usage rather by componenet wise.

I like Mac keyboard and weight compared to my toshibha not sure my next laptop will be MacBook.
