      <description>At HasGeek we decided to spend part of summer in McleodGanj. This tripâ€™s main focus was to code and enjoy beauteous mcleodganj surrounding.
Trip We(Kiran, Supreeth, Haris, Praseetha, me) started from Bangalore 13, April, 2013 and returned on 1, May, 2013. I have uploaded the photos in FaceBook, notes of food items I had in the trip, list of places visited in McleodGanj.
Following is the breakup of the trip cost.</description>
