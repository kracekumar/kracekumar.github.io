      <description>Observations from handling python workshop in engineering colleges
I handled 5 python workshop/sessions for novices from 8th march to 20th august, each one stretching from 1 hour to 2 days. It was worth the time.
Students who participated in the workshop where from Computer Science, Electronics background of Under Graduate and Post Graduate level. Minimum strength was 60 and maximum was close to 100.
 When handling the strength of 60 students in lab, remember every one have their own pace of picking up.</description>

      <description>Avoid accessing wrong column in csv
I was parsing few csv files. All were from same provider. Format isDate, Name, Email, Company, City etc in one file. I made an assumption all the downloaded files are in the same format. For my surprise few files had same format and others dinâ€™t.
with open(filename, &#39;rb&#39;) as f: reader = csv.reader(f) reader.next() # first row contains column names for row in reader: name, email, company = row[1], row[2], row[3] #save to db  In the above code the fundamental mistake is fixing the position of the columns in csv file.</description>
