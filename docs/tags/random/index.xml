      <description>On my way back to home from work I was thinking, I should take rest. In my world rest always meant working on some non work codebase, reading a book, watching a movie. But I donâ€™t want to do any of these. Then I thought I would just listen to songs, quickly remembered that will not work out because I will start coding.
Finally I started to ask myself, is it possible for any human being to sit idle and take rest.</description>
