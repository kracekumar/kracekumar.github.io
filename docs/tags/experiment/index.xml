      <description>I live in 5th floor, my table is near window. I spent saturday by watching 3 documentaries and 1 tamil movie Sindhu Bhairavi, yes no single line of code. Once I am done with movie it was 00:30 AM, now stepped into the balcony was mesmerized by breeze. I felt like a poet and casual thoughts.Yes breeze indeed brought a new thought seed from distant place, “How about coding from balcony”.</description>
