      <description>I’m attending Recurse Center fall&#39;02, 2016 batch. I’m excited (yes, without emoticons) to be in RC and New York. RC is different from schools, boot camps, universities for various reasons. The two reason I like the most is “Never Graduate” and “self-directed learning.”
A lot to learn from peers, experiments, and discussions. Next, 12 weeks will be intense and what can a programmer ask for more than time to solve problems and understand how things for.</description>

      <description>Hacker School is a three-month, full-time school in New York for becoming a better programmer for free, but stay, travels is yours.
I have no idea how much it will cost for travel from India, stay, food, internet, transit so I asked the question in Quora. I got pretty good answers.
Then I started do my lame math.
Monthly Expense(USD)  Rent = 1000 Phone = 80 Transit = 100 Internet = 40 Electricity = 40 Food = 250 Snacks = 100 Outing = 120 Misc = 100  Total = 1830.</description>
