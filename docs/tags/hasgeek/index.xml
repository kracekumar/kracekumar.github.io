      <description>Today (31-12-2013) is my last working day at HasGeek. It was in July 2012, I joined HasGeek. It was fabulous journey for past 18 months, meeting lot of new people, being part of events, writing lot of code. I was part of large, medium, small conferences like Fifth elephant (2012, 2013), Cartonama (2012), JSFoo(2012, 2013), Droidcon (2012, 2013), Metarefresh (2013), various hacknight and geekup.
