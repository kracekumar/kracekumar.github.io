      <description>Hacker School is a three-month, full-time school in New York for becoming a better programmer for free, but stay, travels is yours.
I have no idea how much it will cost for travel from India, stay, food, internet, transit so I asked the question in Quora. I got pretty good answers.
Then I started do my lame math.
Monthly Expense(USD)  Rent = 1000 Phone = 80 Transit = 100 Internet = 40 Electricity = 40 Food = 250 Snacks = 100 Outing = 120 Misc = 100  Total = 1830.</description>
