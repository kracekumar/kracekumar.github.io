      <description>This week, I made considerable progress on the BitTorrent client which I started a week back. The client is in a usable state to download the data from the swarm. The source code is available on GitHub. The project uses Python 3.5 async/await and asyncio. I presented the torrent client in RC Thursday five minute presentation evening slot. Here is the link to the slides.
 Here is quick video demo recorded with asciinema.</description>

      <description>The long awaited Recurse Center debut day, 26th Sep 2016 kick started with a welcome note by Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock and David Albert ; decorated by other events and activities to get to know the batchmates; the culture of RC and ended with closing note by Sonali Sridhar.

 At the end of the day, I had decided to build a BitTorrent client as a first project. I was at the crossroad to choose Python or Rust or Go for the project.</description>
